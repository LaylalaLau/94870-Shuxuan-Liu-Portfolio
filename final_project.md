# Final project Writeup

## Part III

### Storyboard Design

<img src="final_project_1.png" width="1000">

The story starts with a box plot on people's rating of enjoyment of different activities. Gaming was once a very popular leisure activity. I added this section in Part III because based on the feedback I received, some interviwees thought the purpose of the story was to analyze the gaming market. 

Then I used graphs on video game sales to show gaming was gradually losing popularity, and people are now spending more time on other entertainments. I chose line graph for this secion because I wanted to show a shrinking trend. 

I closed with a bubble chart on how people spend their leisure time now and a paragraph for call to action. 

In my original design, I hardly used any texts in the story. When implementing it, I find it's very helpful to use texts to point out important area in the graph and guide people through the story.

In terms of colors and the design of the story board, setting a general theme in color really made it easier to choose what colors to use in visualiations and what images to use as background. I also used text over media for most of the story since I'm relying heavily on visualzations rather than texts.

### Target audience
My intended audience is people who wants to learn about trends in leisure activities. For instance, people working in the advertising industry might like to know how people spend their leisure time to decide advertising platforms (TV, social media, or gaming, etc.).
