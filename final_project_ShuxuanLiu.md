# Final project overview

### Outline 

I spend much of my free time playing video games on Switch and PS5 with my friends. Therefore, for this project, I intend to study and visualize data about video games. 

Gaming has evolved to become a multibillion-dollar market today. In my project, I would visualize the trend of global/regional video game sales (line chart), correlation of video game score and sales (scatter plot), and how much of total sales games from each genre/platform/publisher makes up (bar chart, pie chart, stacked area graph, bubble chart, heatmaps, etc.). I hope the audience can have a better sense of how the gaming market evolves, and what games are most popular after reading my story. I also hope to discover some good games as well ^_^

### Initial Sketches

I will use a line chart to show trend in global/regional video game sales. The header will be "Global/Regional Video Game Sales in Millions". The x-axis is year and the y-axis is sales.

I will use a scatter plot to draw the correlation of video game score and sales. The header will be "Video Game Score V.S. Sales". The x-axis is score and the y-axis is sales. There are two sets of scores (critic score and user score) for each game. I will use yellow points to represent user score, green points to represent critic score.

th
The next visualization is on the proportion of total sales games from each genre/platform/publisher makes up. The header will include the most popular genre/platform/publisher. I can use a bubble chart, where the size of the bubble represents the proportion. A bar chart, pie chart or stacked area chart, where the length, proportion or area represents how much the category makes up in the total sales. I could also use a heat map, where the axises are genre/platform/publisher, and color of different saturation representing sales.

### Data

The data is from data.world. 
A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 
A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first. 

### Method and Medium
In a few paragraphs, you should document how you plan on completing your final project.  One option we've already discussed is building a story using your data using Shorthand - but this is my no means your only option.  You may select another digital platform (e.g. Esri's Story Maps, etc.), or you may propose doing something else entirely (AR / VR, mixed media, etc.).  If you choose to do something significantly outside of the technologies we've introduced in this course, please talk to me first.  I'd like all final projects to be documented digitally, so if you create something using physical materials  or more immersive, you may need to also create a video recording of your story. 

Finally, for your final project presentation I'd discourage an over-reliance on PowerPoint slides. If you need to use a few slides to frame the context of your final project presentation (a pitch deck) that's ok - but your Powerpoint slides alone are not sufficient in meeting the requirements of the final project deliverable.  Your final project deliverable must be an interactive, stand-alone project (e.g. something you've created using Shorthand or another platform) that won't require a future employer clicking through yet another PowerPoint deck.
