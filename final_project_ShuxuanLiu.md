# Final project overview

### Outline 

I spend much of my free time playing video games on Switch and PS5 with my friends. Therefore, for this project, I intend to study and visualize data about video games. 

Gaming has evolved to become a multibillion-dollar market today. In my project, I would visualize the trend of global/regional video game sales (line chart), correlation of video game score and sales (scatter plot), and how much of total sales games from each genre/platform/publisher makes up (bar chart, pie chart, stacked area graph, bubble chart, heatmaps, etc.). I hope the audience can have a better sense of how the gaming market evolves, and what games are most popular after reading my story. I also hope to discover some good games as well ^_^

### Data
https://data.world/sumitrock/video-games-sales
A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 
A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first. 

### Method and Medium
In a few paragraphs, you should document how you plan on completing your final project.  One option we've already discussed is building a story using your data using Shorthand - but this is my no means your only option.  You may select another digital platform (e.g. Esri's Story Maps, etc.), or you may propose doing something else entirely (AR / VR, mixed media, etc.).  If you choose to do something significantly outside of the technologies we've introduced in this course, please talk to me first.  I'd like all final projects to be documented digitally, so if you create something using physical materials  or more immersive, you may need to also create a video recording of your story. 

Finally, for your final project presentation I'd discourage an over-reliance on PowerPoint slides. If you need to use a few slides to frame the context of your final project presentation (a pitch deck) that's ok - but your Powerpoint slides alone are not sufficient in meeting the requirements of the final project deliverable.  Your final project deliverable must be an interactive, stand-alone project (e.g. something you've created using Shorthand or another platform) that won't require a future employer clicking through yet another PowerPoint deck.
