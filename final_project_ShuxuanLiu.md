# Final project Overview

## Part I

### Outline 

I spend much of my free time playing video games on Switch and PS5 with my friends. Therefore, for this project, I intend to study and visualize data about video games. 

Gaming has evolved to become a multibillion-dollar market today. In my project, I would visualize the trend of global/regional video game sales (line chart), correlation of video game score and sales (scatter plot), and how much of total sales games from each genre/platform/publisher makes up (bar chart, pie chart, stacked area graph, bubble chart, heatmaps, etc.). I hope the audience can have a better sense of how the gaming market evolves, and what games are most popular after reading my story. I also hope to discover some good games as well ^_^

### Initial Sketches

I will use a line chart to show trend in global/regional video game sales. The header will be "Global/Regional Video Game Sales in Millions". The x-axis is year and the y-axis is sales.

I will use a scatter plot to draw the correlation of video game score and sales. The header will be "Video Game Score V.S. Sales". The x-axis is score and the y-axis is sales. There are two sets of scores (critic score and user score) for each game. I will use yellow points to represent user score, green points to represent critic score.

th
The next visualization is on the proportion of total sales games from each genre/platform/publisher makes up. The header will include the most popular genre/platform/publisher. I can use a bubble chart, where the size of the bubble represents the proportion. A bar chart, pie chart or stacked area chart, where the length, proportion or area represents how much the category makes up in the total sales. I could also use a heat map, where the axises are genre/platform/publisher, and color of different saturation representing sales.

### Data

Source: https://data.world/sumitrock/video-games-sales
![](data.png)
The data is from data.world. It contains the platform, year of release, genre, publisher, global/regional sales, and score of 16719 games. 

### Method and Medium
I will build the graphs and plots using Tableau and Flourish. The story will be built using Shorthand. It will consist of approximately three to five graphs.
