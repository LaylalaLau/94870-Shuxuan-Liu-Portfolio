# About me
### Hello!
My name is Shuxuan Liu. You can call me Layla.

Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Information Systems Management (BIDA track) degree at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy.

Before that, I graduated from New York Univeristy Shanghai with a Bachelor of Science in computer science and data science.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to create a publicly accessible portfolio not only for the course, but also as a platform where I can demonstrate my work.
